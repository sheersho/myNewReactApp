        <h2>Business Description</h2>

        Sheersho Pramanik has identified four distinct market segments that will be interested in the software product. These segments are the most likely consumers of the software. The segments are as follows:

Centers for Independent Living– These centers exist to help train individuals with developmental disabilities to live on their own. The curriculum is often based around four primary lifeskills that are necessary for the individuals to have in order to successfully live independently.
School Districts– All states are required to provide education for students of special needs until they reach the age of 21. The school districts are often the educational providers until the students are 18 and will be interested in FoodFun’s software as they help the students obtain fundamental lifeskills.
Proactive Parents– Parents who are taking an active role in the education of their children will be looking for aids that they can use at home to help with their child’s learning progress.
Agencies– Many states have formed agencies that act as brokers to connect service providers with individuals. The agencies have generally been formed as a result of a settlement or payout from a lawsuit (including class action).
